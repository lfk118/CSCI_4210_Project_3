# CSCI_4210_Project_3

All data are collected from https://pems.dot.ca.gov and should only be used for educational purpose.

The detectors' order along the US 101-S should be:
1.  	Oregon Expwy on diag
2.  	Oregon Expwy rm-s-diag
3.  	oppo Embarcadero Rd rm-n-coll
4.  	S of Clarke Ave
5.  	University Ave rm-s-diag
6.  	University Ave on 
7.  	Willow Rd rm-s-diag
8.  	Willow Rd rm-s-loop

You should notice that I only choose 8 detectors/stations along the road and you should feel free to use the data from any other unused detector/station if you want.
