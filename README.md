# CSCI_4210_Project_3

All data are collected from https://pems.dot.ca.gov and should only be used for educational purpose.

The detectors' order along the US 101-S should be:
  	[Oregon Expwy on diag][https://pems.dot.ca.gov/?pagenum_all=1&station_id=404566&dnode=search&content=cnt_search&center=37.445696%2C-122.119856&zoom=15&view=e]
  	Oregon Expwy rm-s-diag
  	oppo Embarcadero Rd rm-n-coll
  	S of Clarke Ave
  	University Ave rm-s-diag
  	University Ave on 
  	Willow Rd rm-s-diag
  	Willow Rd rm-s-loop

You should notice that I only choose 8 detectors/stations along the road and you should feel free to use the data from any other unused detector/station if you want.
